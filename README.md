# learning-to-count-binary
this is a simple recurrent neural network code for better understanding the architecture of this beautiful algorithm
 
this code is to teach machine how to count binary number as we know there is no fix rule of counting binary as in 1,1 appears in unit place ,in 2 it appers in second place but in three it appears in both places so it is hard to find out any sequence among them but only in 100 iteration it got 10 out of 15 right. this is the power of reccurent neural network as this question cannot be solver by traditional neural network  counting binary is not an easy task as there are rules and logic to count.
